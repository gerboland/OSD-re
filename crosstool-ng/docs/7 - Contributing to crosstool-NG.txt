If you want to enhance crosstool-NG, there's a to-do list in the TODO file.

Patches should come with the appropriate SoB line. A SoB line is typically
something like:
   Signed-off-by: John DOE <john.doe@somewhere.net>

The SoB line is clearly described in Documentation/SubmittingPatches , section
12, of your favourite Linux kernel source tree.


For larger or more frequent contributions, mercurial should be used.
There is a nice, complete and step-by-step tutorial in section 'C'.
