      Do not use a C library.
      
      This is usefull if your project is self-contained, does not rely on
      an external C library, and provides all the necessary bits.
      
      Most probably usefull to bootloaders, as they generally don't depend
      on the C library.
      
      If unsure: do *not* choose that, and use another option in the choice.
