      Add support for the Signal Processing Engine.  This will set up
      the toolchain so that it supports the SPE ABI extensions. This
      mainly targets Freescale e500 processors.
      
      Setting this option will append "spe" to the end of your target
      tuple name (e.g., powerpc-e500v2-linux-gnuspe) so that the gcc
      configure/build system will know to include SPE ABI support.
      It will also automatically add "-mabi=spe -mspe" to your
      TARGET_CFLAGS, and "--enable-e500_double" to your CC_EXTRA_CONFIG,
      so you do not need to explicitly add them.
