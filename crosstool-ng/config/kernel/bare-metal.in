# Bare metal config options

config KERNEL_bare_metal
    select BARE_METAL
    help
      'Bare metal' refers to those programs that run without any kernel.
      
      You probably want to say 'y' here if you plan to use your compiler
      to build bootloaders. It is not yet suitable to build Linux kernels,
      though, because the APCI stuff relies on the target C library headers
      being available?!?!...
