/dl - this folder is empty*

This folder holds all tarballs of source code downloaded by build systems 
(both buildroot and crosstool-ng). This includes archives of any CVS, SVN,
GIT, BZR or or other supported repo which is cloned/checked-out.

* It's empty to start, until you set a build going of course. Also it's never
wholly empty since this file is in it. One of those "this page is intentionally
kept blank" messages.
