Kernels directory
-----------------

kernels/linux-2.6.14-headers
  Contains a sanitised set of header files from version 2.6.14. I've borrowed these 
  from one of the excellent pre-built toolchains supplied by Codesourcery[1].

  This was done as I had problems compiling a working toolchain against Neuros'
  header files. Certain symbols were missing.


kernels/linux-2.6.15-neuros-eabi
  Contains the source code of the kernel supplied by Neuros, with the following changes
    - EABI support, using a patch set[2] (not all applied cleanly, so hand done)
    - EABI caused unusual error, most network communication would fail. Running
      wireshark showed that packets the OSD was sending were bad - their header
      checksum was incorrect. Turned out that the assembly code in 
      include/asm-arm/checksum.h needed a fix found in later kernels.
    - Squashfs support

  Note the neuros defconfig here isn't used by Buildroot. Use the one specified in 
  buildroot/board/neuros/osd to customise the kernel.
