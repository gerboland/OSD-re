config ARM_AM79C961A
	bool "ARM EBSA110 AM79C961A support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_EBSA110
	select CRC32
	help
	  If you wish to compile a kernel for the EBSA-110, then you should
	  always answer Y to this.

config ARM_ETHER1
	tristate "Acorn Ether1 support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	help
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these (AKA25) network cards,
	  you should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config ARM_ETHER3
	tristate "Acorn/ANT Ether3 support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	help
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
	  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config ARM_ETHERH
	tristate "I-cubed EtherH/ANT EtherM support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	select CRC32
	help
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
	  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config ARM_ETHER00
	tristate "Altera Ether00 support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_CAMELOT
	help
	  This is the driver for Altera's ether00 ethernet mac IP core. Say
	  Y here if you want to build support for this into the kernel. It
	  is also available as a module (say M here) that can be inserted/
	  removed from the kernel at the same time as the PLD is configured.
	  If this driver is running on an epxa10 development board then it
	  will generate a suitable hw address based on the board serial
	  number (MTD support is required for this). Otherwise you will
	  need to set a suitable hw address using ifconfig.

config SMC91X_INGENIENT
	tristate "SMC 91C9x/91C1xxx support -Ingenient"
	select CRC32
	select MII
	depends on ARM
	help
	  This is a driver for SMC's 91x series of Ethernet chipsets,
	  including the SMC91C94 and the SMC91C111. Say Y if you want it
	  compiled into the kernel, and read the file
	  <file:Documentation/networking/smc9.txt>  and the Ethernet-HOWTO,
	  available from  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called smc91x.  If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
	  as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

config SMC911X_INGENIENT
	tristate "SMC 911X support -Ingenient"

	select MII
	depends on ARM
	help
	  This is a driver for SMC's 911x series of Ethernet chipsets,
          LAN911x refers to the following chips.

	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called smc91x.  If you want to compile it as a

config DMA_NET_RX
	bool "SMC 911X RX DMA support -Ingenient"
	depends on SMC911X_INGENIENT || SMC91X_INGENIENT
	help
	   This option is used to select DMA for Rx operation
config DMA_NET_TX
	bool "SMC 911X TX DMA support -Ingenient"
	depends on SMC911X_INGENIENT || SMC91X_INGENIENT
	help
	   This option is used to select DMA for Tx operation

config DM9KS
	tristate "Davicom dm9ks support"

	select MII
	depends on ARM
	help
	  This is a driver for Davicom's dm9ks of Ethernet chipsets,
	  including the dm9000A and the dm9010. Say Y if you want it
	  compiled into the kernel.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called smc91x.  If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here.
