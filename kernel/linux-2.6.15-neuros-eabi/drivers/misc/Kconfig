config IBM_ASM
	tristate "Device driver for IBM RSA service processor"
	depends on X86 && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the
	  IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems.
	  The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access
	  ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service
	  processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with
	  a user space API.
	  The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the
	  service processor board as a regular serial port. To make use of
	  this feature serial driver support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250) must be
	  enabled.
	  
	  WARNING: This software may not be supported or function
	  correctly on your IBM server. Please consult the IBM ServerProven
	  website <http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/eserver/xseries/serverproven> for
	  information on the specific driver level and support statement
	  for your IBM server.


	  If unsure, say N.

config NEUROS_GENERIC
	tristate "Neuros generic (multipurpose) driver"
	depends on ARCH_ITDM3XX
	---help---
	  This option enables a generic multipurpose driver intended for Neuros
	  products (mainly the OSD).

	  Currently, this driver includes support for setting the system clock
	  frequency via the on-chip PLL.

	  To compile this driver as a module (recommended), choose M here: the
	  module will be called neuros_generic.

	  If unsure and targeting the Neuros OSD, say M.
	  
config NEUROS_IR_BLASTER
	tristate "Neuros IR blaster driver"
	depends on ARCH_ITDM3XX
	---help---
	  This option enables the Neuros IR blaster driver.

	  TODO: This needs a better description.

	  To compile this driver as a module (recommended), choose M here: the
	  module will be called neuros_ir_blaster.

	  If unsure and targeting the Neuros OSD, say M.
	  
config XLOCK
	tristate "xlock driver"
	---help---
	  This option enables the xlock driver.

	  TODO: This needs a better description.

	  To compile this driver as a module (recommended), choose M here: the
	  module will be called xlock.

	  If unsure and targeting the Neuros OSD, say M.
