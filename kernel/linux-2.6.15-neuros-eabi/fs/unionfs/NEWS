* Unionfs 1.1.5
- Backport: Corrected sample mount commands
- Backport: Fixed link-unlink issue

* Unionfs 1.1.1
- Directory reading is fixed
- Improved locking for branch manipulation operations
- Fix for removing an opaque directory
- Some cleanups and error handling fixes to the copyup code

* Unionfs 1.1.0
- Removed excess 2.4 code (Unionfs 1.1.0 is for 2.6 only)
- Removed file locking code, as the VFS does a better job of it.
- Fixed off by one errors when kmallocing names in inode.c.

- AMD64 fix for compiling on gentoo.
- Properly update generation when we combine copyup and reopening.
- Cleanedup Makefile to remove 2.4 clutter.
- Added documentation for the MODDIR option in the INSTALL file.

* Unionfs 1.0.14
Features:
- Dropped unmaintained setattr,diropaque,delete=first and mount flags
- Updated unionfs.4 to reflect default mount modes
- You can use the root of the Union to remove branches with unionctl
- Use official Debian packaging files.
- Linux 2.6.13 support.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed several dentry refcount bugs introduced by new deletion framework.
- Fixed uninitialized fd_set in the query ioctl.
- Branch reference counting now works across insertion and removal of branches.
  This prevents the branch counts from getting "confused".
- Handle "/" as a branch in unionctl.
- Removed static buffer for debug prints in favor of vprintk.
- NFS silly renames avoided during several cases.
- Attempting a write lock causes a copyup, so that the underying flock will
  work.
- Cleaned up mount option parsing.
- Improved link counting for directories.

* Unionfs 1.0.13
- Unionfs now handles deleting an open file (and several other deletion fixes).
  Thanks to the Knoppix people and Tomas Matejicek for finding these bugs.
- The NODEBUG flag has been renamed to UNIONFS_NDEBUG.
- Instead of allocating all of the lower-level pointers in dentries, inodes
  and files, we have a fixed number of them preallocated and malloc only if
  we exceed that number.
- Fixed a dentry reference count bug with UNIONFS_NDEBUG.
- Support for persistent inode numbers across mounts.
- Added a "which-branch" ioctl and corresponding --query to unionctl, so that
  it is possible to find out where a file or directory is coming from.
- In 2.6.11 and onwards, don't take the BKL for ioctls.

* Unionfs 1.0.12
- Copy-up is delayed until a write operation occurs, so spurious copy-ups are
  avoided.
- Improved copyup UID spoofing for mkdir
- Instructions and shell script for compiling Unionfs into a monolothic kernel.
- Added support for opaque directories, which mask the contents of
  lower-priority directories.  This makes recreating a removed directory an
  O(1)  operation instead of an O(n) operation, and also makes subsequent
  operations faster.  There were also several whiteout related fixes bundled
  in here.
- Fixed bug with whiteouts on Reiserfs
- Fixed bug when a file transitioned from a negative dentry to a positive
  dentry (i.e., if you add a branch that inserts a file you previously
  looked up, but did not exist)
- Fixed return code for extended attribute functions
- amd64 compile fixes
- Extended attribute copy-up
- Unionfs returns EXDEV instead of copying up a directory on move, this
  fixes a bug where Unionfs would "forget" the contents of a copied up
  directory after unmount.
- Fix for following symlinks
- Improved print routines (separated generic from unionfs printing routines)
- INSTALL has some instructions for using Unionfs as a root file system and
  also for using Unionfs with Selinux.
- Dentry private data uses a separate kmem_cache and inodes in 2.6 use their
  own kmem_cache.  This should improve performance a bit because there are
  fewer individual memory allocations (and less wasted space).

* Unionfs 1.0.11
This release fixes NFS exporting which was broken in 1.0.10.
- f_pos and lseek's offsets are unified, so readdir works on NFS exported
  unionfs mounts again.

* Unionfs 1.0.10
This release fixes several bugs over 1.0.9, but it will not correctly work if
you want to NFS export it.  For that you need to use 1.0.9 on 2.4.  In 1.0.11,
we will fix NFS exports correctly.

- Don't d_delete entries that don't have positive refcounts (Fabian Franz)
- Hardlinks should point to the same inode (Fabian Franz)
- File locking works correctly.
- Improved directory llseeking.
- snapmerge preserves permissions/times after copying files
- Improved Makefile
- Unionfs_d_revalidate copies attributes so the cache appears more coherent.
- Directory reading bug fixed.
- symlink copyup fixed
- Don't oops when creating files longer than 252 characters
- Some readdir fixes.
- df produces correct size results

* Unionfs 1.0.9
- Fixed copyup permissions bugs (Anton Farygin)
- NTFS mmap will no longer cause Oops (but it won't do the mmap, as NTFS
  doesn't support mmap).
- Moved directory reading helper routines into dirhelper.c from subr.c
- We no longer require hacked copies of vfs_create and vfs_unlink
- Moved finding and adding filldir_nodes into rdstate.c
- Added a sample RPM spec file, for those who want to package Unionfs
  (Note, we are currently not distributing source or binary RPMS)
- Fixed unionfs_link to allow hard-linking of files with a source of a
  readonly file system.
- Fixed apt-get on rw/ro branch configuration (related to unionfs_link)
- Modified regression/link.sh to reflect the changes in unionfs_link. It
  now includes tests to make sure linking on a read only filesystem works.
- Fixed an issue where unionfs_dir_llseek would cause an Oops

* Unionfs 1.0.8
- Fixed bug with readdir (but oddly not ls) that prevented that last entry
  from being shown.
- Include INSTALL file with information about installing Unionfs.
- Fix unionctl bug with "/" as the path to search for
- Fix to copyup permissions on directories
- Allow llseek to current directory position, but no others

* Unionfs 1.0.7
- Fixed locking for readdir state, this fixes a kernel Oops on preemptive
  kernels, and deadlocks on SMP kernels.
- Prevent readdir from giving -ESTALE on last entry.
- Fixes for gcc 2.9.5 (Alex de Landegraaf)
- Debian package scripts (Alex de Landegraaf)
- NFS Export on 2.6 (Sai Suman)
- Copyup permissions fix (Sai Suman)
- Warn when compiling on unsupported kernels (<2.6.9 or <2.4.20)
- Improved hardlink support (but not quite there yet)

* Unionfs 1.0.6
A lot of code has changed in the 1.0.6 release, so it may not be as stable as
the 1.0.5 release.

- Makefile fix over 1.0.5 for install target on 2.6
- unionfs.h, fist.h Makefile dependency fixed
- Support for readdir over NFS
- Hash table sizes are now based on the size of the lower-level directory
- In 2.4 inode private data resides in the inode.u field, saving memory
- Use kmem caches for filldir nodes rather than wasting space with extra
  large kmallocs, also move short names inline

* Unionfs 1.0.5
- Support for both 2.6 and 2.4 kernels

* Unionfs 1.0.4
- Copyup now correctly handles directories, devices, and symlinks.
- Extended attributes are now off by default because they cause too many
  compile problems.
- The regression tests is now included in the release, but is not actually
  installed.  These tests are rather primitive, but do check some fundamental
  Unionfs behavior on multiple branches.

* Unionfs 1.0.3
- Compile fixes for older (and newer) compilers than found on Redhat 9.
- Compile fixes for older kernels.
- Don't Oops when passed bad directories.

* Unionfs 1.0.2
- Minor README updates

* Unionfs 1.0.1
- Fix to release target which includes manual pages.

* Unionfs 1.0
- First public release
