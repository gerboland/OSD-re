We're pleased to announce the first release of a unioning file system
for Linux, called Unionfs.  To download software and documentation,
see

	http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-unionfs.html

Unionfs is a stackable unification file system, which can appear to
merge the contents of several directories (branches), while keeping
their physical content separate.  Unionfs is useful for unified source
tree management, merged contents of split CD-ROM, merged separate
software package directories, data grids, and more.  Unionfs allows
any mix of read-only and read-write branches, as well as insertion and
deletion of branches anywhere in the fan-out.  To maintain Unix
semantics, Unionfs handles elimination of duplicates, partial-error
conditions, and more.  This release also includes additional
preliminary features that were specifically designed for security
applications, such as snapshotting and sandboxing.

This Unionfs release has been tested with recent 2.6 kernels.  For
2.6 kernels, the minimum requirement is 2.6.9.  You also need to have
the development headers for e2fsprogs installed.

Unionfs is released under the GPL (see the COPYING file in the
distribution for details).

For more information on using Unionfs, download the tarball and see
the following man pages:

- unionfs.4:  Describes how to mount unionfs

- unionctl.8: Describes how to control an already mounted Union

For more information about Unionfs internals (which we think are
really cool :-), see the following technical report at the above Web
site:

In addition, you can find an article in Linux Journal (December 2004
issue) titled "Unionfs: Bringing File Systems Together."  It is available
online at http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7714.

See the INSTALL file for instructions on building Unionfs, iteractions with
kernel features, and known bugs and limitations.

To report bugs, please email them to the "fistgen@filesystems.org"
list (see www.filesystems.org), or submit them via Bugzilla to
https://bugzilla.filesystems.org/.  But reports with fixes are most
welcome.

Enjoy,
Erez and Charles (on behalf of the Unionfs team)
